          <p>This is the first of two works inpired by BTS RM's solo playlist, "mono". The song "everythingoes" maintains a quality that's lighter than air, making you feel like you could walk out of a rainstorm and ascend into the heavens.</p>
          <p>It's kind of hard not to daydream, or wish you were stargazing, while listening, and this is the same feeling I have tried to evoke through this piece.</p>
          <p>All of the album art for"mono" is monochrome, as is the music video for another song off the album, "forever rain". I played off of these parts of the album quite a bit, and made sure to use my tablet's "monotype" drawing function to
            create the title.</p>

          <p>The second of my works inspired by "mono". Two of the main tracks off of the album are "moonchild" and "forever rain", which focus on being okay with being alone with yourself, and coming into one's own in the midst of everything going
            on with the world.</p>
          <p>This work draws especially from the art style of the "forever rain" music video, which has a unique animation style and pays homage to abstract art, as well as from the font on the cover of the album.</p>
          <p>I tried to use lighting and paint effects to create a subtle moon in the background of the figure. As the song goes, "moonchild, don't cry, when moon rise, it's your time".</p>

          <p>This was a quick doodle I made testing out the paint settings on some new software. The color scheme and words come from BTS' "Love Yourself" album series, which is one of my favorites.</p>

          <p>One of my favorite band of all time is Young the Giant, an indie rock band who have just released their fourth album, "Mirror Master".</p>
          <p>Since YTG doesn't have a huge line of merch, to celebrate their new album I decided to create a sticker that I could print for myself that combined three of their four album covers into one graphic, and this is what I ended up with!</p>
