          <p>This is the first page of a brochure that I created for my internship with Shanti Life India Foundation this past summer. </p>
          <p>These brochures were given out during our first ever fundraising event in California, as a bit of an introduction to what Shanti is and does, and who Shanti helps.</p>
          <p>This brochure uses real photos from Shanti's efforts in India, and draws both from the colors of the Indian flag (and the Shanti logo) and from the colors present in the photos from India</p>
          <p>I was also responsible for writing all of the content for this brochure, so it is really a labor of love for me!</p>

          <p>This is the logo I created for the business of a close family friend, who is becoming a chef and aspires to cater for small events once she is trained</p>
          <p>This was used to create her business cards, and is on the business's website, which I'm also helping to design.</p>
