      <h2>POSTERS</h2>
      <section class="image-container-grid">
        <section>
          <div class="imagebox project1"><img src="posters/poster1.jpg" alt="poster1"></div>
          <p>This poster was inspired by music and fashion icon David Bowie. I wanted to emulate the simple and bold style choices that truly made him stand out as Ziggy Stardust.<p>
              <p> I also drew inspiration from his jumpsuit and from Aladdin Sane's lightning bolt icon to create the background; I thought the lines on his jumpsuit looked like grooves on a record.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="imagebox project2"><img src="posters/poster2.jpg" alt="poster2"></div>
          <p>This design pays homage to the font ITC Avante Garde. Groundbreaking in its modernity, this font has a bit of an interesting and scandalous history, which I included a bit of in the design. </p>
          <p>The angular nature of Avant Garde brought me to the final look for the poster, which relies on clean lines, sharp edges, and the colors of Avant Garde magazine.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="imagebox project3"><img src="posters/poster3.jpg" alt="poster3"></div>
          <p>Another poster inspired by Bowie. I chose to mix some classic elements of sci-fi and fantasy film posters with Bowie's nickname, "Starman", to create the look for this poster.</p>
          <p>Remembering both Bowie's career in music and his career in acting, I wanted to invoke the feeling of listening to "Ziggy Stardust" or watching "Labyrinth" for the first time. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="imagebox project3"><img src="posters/poster4.jpg" alt="poster4"></div>
          <p>When tasked to create a poster for an event, I was inspired by my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio and one of our biggest attractions, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
          <p>Both the place and subject of this poster are dear to me (considering my parents raised me on rock just five minutes away from Lake Erie), so I did my best to do the Hall and the inductees justice with this poster.</p>
          <p>I drew from imagery that has been used in many posters for this event in the past, guitars and flame, but tried to keep the same vibrancy and lively energy that you would find at a rock show.</p>
